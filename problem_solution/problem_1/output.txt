By 1:30 pm on January 3rd, my new glasses had a sudden blur.Two minutes later, when the situation started to get unbearable, it was all again.But after that, I couldn't find a thing anywhere from the table.The thing is very little, a stone paper weight, a thick round wheel size of green and black granite, Buddhist thunder in the middle.Nowadays the paperweight is no more, but it gave it to one.As a memory of him, I had everything he had.Lost the mind was bad.
There is another monument in the cupboard in my office, a ring given by him, the green and black mixing stone of the tailor.There was a rate of way with the ring, I gave him it.No one knows about these things.Not a mother, not Shravanti.
Opening the cupboard, I saw the ring is in the right place.But there is no other thing about the other thing!What to doAnd where is it?I could not find any thought.Essentially I gave my mind to work.However, discomfort and regret remained in the mind.


Aminia shop on the way back from the office.It seemed that they did not eat their kebab for a long time.Run the best medicine to fill the mind shortage.I entered and played myself, took the house for the house.What I thought, my mind was better than myself.
After returning home, everyone is happy to see the kebab and parota.Srivanti, specially, loves it again.Poor!
After returning home, everyone is happy to see the kebab and parota
The 5th was gone, the 5th was back.The same thing at the same time again yesterday.The glasses of the glasses were blurred, and I could not delete, I could not open it.It seemed as if someone was holding the glasses on my face.After two minutes, everything was cleaned.Then I see the Haro thing sitting right where it was.
What seemed oneI got up and opened the cupboard and saw the ring disappear.This time I did not need the unemployed hard work.I do not know why, but I am sure there is no profit.
What's going on?There is no way to talk to anyone about it.No one will believe.But even bigger than that, I didn't want to tell anyone about things.What a corner of yourself!
I could not mind the work.Mr. Adhikar's phone made a message and said, "The body is feeling bad, the rest of the website design will be finished at home tonight."He has no problem with these.Besides, he trusted me.Then he answered "No problem".
I realized that today it will not be with food, it will need more hard medicines.There are a few times near the office but when you get out of there, anyone in the office has the opportunity to notice.So in a taxi office and the house I appeared in a bar.
When I got out, it was seven in the evening.It's a little lateMoreover, the smell of alcohol on the face.Well, at home, I would say a big deal thru in the office, so there was a party.Then everything will be fine.The mother of the elder will say, "They are a little less Khas", Sravanti will say "He eats, mother."Diameter.
My new glasses were suddenly blurred
Sleep would have been good at night, but at night I dreamed of a bad dream.I saw that I was lying in a double bed in a wooden house.The appearance of the room looks like a homestay in the hill area.Looking out the window, it seemed like something else was hung instead of the screen.I got out of bed and got close.Let's see a cut hand.Nitol Forsa This hand is known to me.Cut, but a single blood is nowhere, just like a graphic cut and paste.


On the other hand, I saw another hand hanging in Sedik's life.Like crazy, the eyes fell under the bed, I saw two feet cut from the bottom of the knee, as if it were arranged.
In the pillow next to me in the bed there is a head, a single open hair but there is nothing nose and ears and lips.Nicole forms like eggs.Gradually, the lips, ears, nose, and finally two boiled eyes erupted.This face is very well known, I want to forget it.
Slowly the eyelids shook.Now open, look at me.Just then I woke up and saw the whole body wet in the sweat.Waking up, Shravanti is looking at me with anxiety.I said, "Everything is fine.I was dreaming of a bad.Fall asleep. "


It would have been good at night, but I dreamed of a bad night at the end of the night
By one and a half in the office again that scandal.This time it is clear, when the cupboard opens, I see the ring with the ring.Once I took both in my hand.The newly opened jewelry is as light as hot.I brought things to my nose.There is a scent mixed with a scent.How did one get in the body.
How is he coming?Why coming?Why not come so long?Where wasWhere is it now?Don't want to knowDon't want to know anything.That life is over.Now this is my life.
Work pressure seems to have taken more than I have taken.The resorts will be a little blank before reading the week of January 26th.Both of them hurried to a weekend on the Ayodhya hill.I thought I had a good place for the agent.
On Friday, the bride-to-be arrived at the resort.The head of the mountains on the opposite side is starting to black and the rice of the resort houses is shining in the falling light.What I thought, people are almost no, no one else on our cottage.Sravanti is very happy.


It was a great time until Saturday afternoon.Once in the afternoon, I went out for a little walk all around.Sravanti was lying in the house because he was caught in Alisari.As soon as he came back, he came out and said, "Tell the manager right now, I will comply about the cottage next to it.A rude girl has come, standing in the window and watching everything inside our room. ‚Äù
"Girl?There is no one in the side cottage. "
"It is said.He had been standing in the window for so long.Now it seems that you are moving away. "
"What kind of girl?"
"I will be old.It looked like Nepali or North East.But it looks pretty good. "
Come on a weeke
The head turned around.Looking at the door next to the cottage, I realized that there was no need to call the manager.The door locks from the outside.The windows are all closed.His face turned white to show Shravanti, then covered his face with his hands to come out.


I got out of it before the sun sank.Then a train is Kolkata.Not in a car ... many people want us now.
Back home, I told my mother that the body felt bad so I came back soon.This is not a lie at all.None of us were feeling healthy.Sravanti is high, he saw him in his own eyes.After coming to bed, the face of the face was no longer trying to cover.He repeatedly said, "I can't forget that eye."At the end, both of them had to sleep after eating drugs.


Sunday morning I usually like it.This Sunday morning with the only thought, what will happen again in the office tomorrow?
All day we did not face the two, both of them tried to spend as much time with my mother.Even after lunch, I did not go to my house and sat down with my mother and spent the story.But after dinner, you have to go to their homes.Tomorrow office, so I will not be able to eat sleeping drugs.No sleep, I do not know when I was thinking about it.Six and a half in the morning, Sravanti hugs me and sleeps.Looking at his face, it was difficult.Besides, there is no surprise in the body.
Then a train to Kolkata
It was quite neat while going to the office.I decided to make three things out of the three.
There was no problem in the office all day.In the afternoon, I went out to stay, with three things in the pocket.A new KMC dustbin is set up near the office.As he walked by the side of the opposite side of the pavement, I quickly dropped the pockets in his pocket.As soon as he reached the opposite, my glasses became completely white.The glasses were pressed on my eyes again.Then someone wearing a ring on my finger, inserted something in the pocket.It is likely, or why not, is definitely a paperweight.
One hand holds my wrist fist.Can't see anything, but this hand, the touch of my hands, I know, very familiar.One day of June eight years ago, on the moment of falling back on a wet stone in Sipijora, my wrist saved me in this way.This hand is pulling me.I do not know where I am going, I am moving forward like a blind, because I know there is no profit by obstructing or trying to leave.The only one tries to try - naturally walking, so that no one in the street is strange.
I do not know how long it has been like this.I do not know where I am going to wander.Just understand that the pavement has not changed.Then stop.I realized that a big door opened in front.Then broke the stairs and climbed the floor.
Suddenly my glasses became clear.I'm standing in front of a door.A familiar name on a wooden nameplate on the door.Prema Rai.
Someone opened the door.Then the hand pulled me inside.I got it, the door behind me was closed.
A houseThe windows are all closed, but the light that comes through the glass is clear.Arranged house.A sofa right in the middle.There is a light burning body on the lightning.Look at me at a glance.The rate of that Darjeeling Stone given to me in the neck.
I don't remember anything else.
